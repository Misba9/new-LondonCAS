                  These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of 
                  England and Wales. Any disputes arising from these Terms or your use of

                <h4>Dispute Resolution</h4>
                <p>
                  We encourage you to contact us first to resolve any disputes informally. 
                  If we cannot resolve a dispute through direct discussion, we may suggest 
                  mediation or other alternative dispute resolution methods before pursuing 
                  formal legal proceedings.

                <p>
                  These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy and any other policies 
                  referenced herein, constitute the entire agreement between you and LCAS

                <p>
                  We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of material 
                  changes by posting the updated Terms on our website and updating the "Last Updated" 
                  date. Your continued use of our services after changes take effect constitutes 
                  acceptance of the new Terms.

                <h4>Severability</h4>
                <p>
                  If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, 
                  the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.

                <h4>Waiver</h4>
                <p>
                  Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms does not constitute 
                  a waiver of that provision or any other provision.
